The Internet has brought about near-instant access to the world's collective knowledge. Paired with great search abilities, it became even faster. Mix in smartphones attached at the hip and rising average bandwidth and it's quicker still. This presents benefits that have been obvious to us for awhile now, but there is also a more subtle byproduct which seems to be occurring: we are outsourcing knowledge and understanding to the Internet.

Search is fast. Google even rubs it in on their results page, by telling you that they returned billions of results in less than a second. This astounding speed is at the point where it can play a part in our quick thought processes---I can find answers faster than I can think of them. The net is also huge and is only growing in size. I know that with more people online there are going to be more people with questions or circumstances like my own (i.e. Stack Exchange). I also don't have all the answers but if I do, what's a few seconds to double-check it on the web? Search is incredibly useful, but the problem arises when we forego our own intuition and our searches go from occasional and insightful to frequent and lazy. How many searches have you done today? Do you still remember what you learned from the results? What about yesterday's searches? How many searches could you have done without or predicted the answer you sought? When we fire off a query as soon as we think about it, we want quick information but we can also dispose of the results just as quickly. This is fine for search results that we don't need to store in long-term memory such as last night's sports score. But for things that matter, such frequent disposal can leave our minds slippery and less able to retain knowledge. It's as if we're substituting our own intuition and memory with the virtual memory of the Internet. It's quick enough, has more answers, and has been specifically built to understand us and deliver exactly what we want.

In a way, we are becoming more *stateless* in letting the Internet provide an increasingly large part of our understanding of the world. We are the terminals, the lazy consumers of the almighty server, the conduits that only consume. We are putting our own understanding on the backburner and swapping in something else and running with it, almost blindly. This can be a dangerous situation without critical thinking; problems arise when our questions also transition from the objective to the subjective and introspective (i.e. "what's the matter with me").

One might rebut by quoting Sean Connery's line from the Last Crusade, "I wrote [it] down so I wouldn't have to remember." Why take up precious space in our brains for something that can be scribbled down somewhere (or Google-searched) for later perusal? even if it's as important as a clue on how not to get decapitated in search of the Holy Grail? To that I would argue Connery's character is referring to information that will hopefully be required only on rare occasion and could be characterized as encyclopedic or nuanced in nature (how do you spell 'Jehova' in Latin?). That might be something worth double-checking.

<!--The Internet has formed a path of lesser resistance and we are starting to travel that path more and more, letting more of our answers and understanding come from search results.-->

<!--Social systems and content aggregation on the web have become monopolies (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, Reddit, Twitter in Alexa's [top 50](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) global websites) and even with more content being made daily, the virtual world is becoming smaller as more people seem to have seen that one video, meme, or tweet. This spells danger for users who are spending more time online and naturally taking more cues from the Internet in curating their opinions, world views, or their character. With more permeation into the fabric of people's lives, extended use of these monopolistic sites fosters homogeneity and shrinks the real world too.-->

We are dumb terminals, but we don't have to be. The terminal is dumb because it has little resources and therefore must outsource work. We, on the other hand, have much more intellect and intuition than we give ourselves credit for. We may not have all the answers, but we can certainly think about them without immediately typing on the keyboard. We find comfort in double-checking our answers, but in some cases, this can be self-doubt in disguise. The aforementioned behavior is mainly the product of laziness, fueled by a frictionless experience, but we don't have to be so lazy. Smartphone apps do a good job of keeping us this way and a step in the right direction is more mindful use of our devices. Search is powerful, but with that power comes responsibility to not let our minds become slippery.

1. Quick Search
  - Internet speeds have increased to current level
  - Phones always on us
  - They have fast access to net
2. We forego own knowledge and use Internet's
      - We are lazy
        - Laziness takes the path of least resistance
      - We have quick search
        - We can type and have autocompleted results faster that we can think critically
      - Internet is huge and probably has answers for similar situations
        - More people online, more articles
        - We don't often have all the answers (come back to: but we have the intuition)
          - We also doubt our own answers/self (or find comfort in double-checking)
            - Come back to: double-checking is a form of doubt
3. We are dumb terminals
      - Terminals
        - Do little work, outsource to server b/c it's faster/easier
      - We are like terminals because we also outsource
        - We are stateless and have started depending on search results
            - Either search was warranted, the results could have been predicted, or the result has been forgotten
            - Dependence leads to more statelessness (e.g. more forgetful, just google again when I need it)
            - Worrisome
              - Monopoly sites making world smaller
              	- Same meme, video, tweet
              		- Empty vessels + smaller world = less to pick from and homogeneity
      - The terminal is really the phone, but thin, client-like characteristics have eeked out of the device, and into our person
        - We have become more like the device
4. We don't have to be
      - We have brain power and intuition
      - We don't have to be so lazy
        - One step in the right direction is to use our phones less
      - Outsourcing knowledge is unhealthy and will leave us worse off
      - Capable of thinking for ourselves



- Quick search => dumb terminal
- Dumb terminal => influenced by social media

- More people using internet
- Internet making world figuratively smaller through monopoly sites
	- Monopoly sites bubble up content either they or the populous wants everyone to see
	- There are enough people using the sites so that people don't have to leave front page to be satisfied (short-term)
- People aren't thinking, instead they're searching
	- It's as fast as thought processes, etc.
- B/c it's fast, people are outsources more questions to search
	- Laziness, terminal---server model
- This leads to statelessness where we are immediately discrediting our own critical thinking and going straight for the search bar
	- eval
- The more we become stateless the more we allow the Internet to make up our world view/character
- As the Internet becomes smaller, this statelessness and impressionability leaves us homogenized
	- Leaves the real world smaller as a result

- The terminal is really the phone, but thin, client-like characteristics have eeked out of the device, and into our person
	- We have become more like the device
