HBO's *Last Week Tonight* is a show I original stopped watching for its repetitive jokes, but has now recently got me thinking about its format underpinnings a bit more. For those of who don't watch or know about the show, it's a late night comedy news program which recaps the major news stories of the previous week with an additional main topic at the end. These main segments bring to light issues that are less current, bigger in scope, and are arguably the main draw to the show. The show has its own YouTube channel where it uploads these segments which draw in several million views each week. It is these stories/essays/segments and the show's format which present danger in their effects on the audience.

First and foremost, the show is entertainment. It airs late at night, sometimes has celebrity guests, and is not without gags and jokes presented by its host, John Oliver. Because it airs late at night (11pm on a Sunday), most people probably watch it the following night after work. The timing of this offers an escape from Monday and the friction of going from the weekend to the week. Despite being primarily entertainment, it is not without viewers who also use it as a source of news. One could argue that this category of viewers is small, but, as mentioned earlier, these topics are often less current and more out of left field, leaving more viewers (informed about recent events or not) unaquainted with the domain. Already, there is some uneven footing; the show is segueing from the comfortable to the unknown and catching the viewer off-guard. This is a dance that has only started.

The show's retelling of the previous week's news is not much different from any other parody news program such as *Saturday Night Live*'s Weekend Update. However, its main story is brought up last and the switch in tone is noticeable. Oliver brings the audience up-to-speed about the topic, which is supported by clips of national news' outlets coverage. The topics are often somewhat somber, such as corrupt elections, U.S. domestic or foreign policy, the police, immigration, Donald Trump, and scandals. Through the introduction of the story, the viewer may experience a let-down, of sorts. This retelling of events triggers one's stress or aggression. Up until this point, the show is largely the same as ordinary news outlets: worrisome and exciting because it unsettles us. Then, Oliver lands a joke about the whole thing. Suddenly, the brain finds comfort from the humor and is brought back up. We laugh and feel better. The joke softens the blow and before we know it, we have been strapped into an emotional roller coaster; the show has corrected course; it has given us the poison and sold us the cure. This up-and-down/ebb-and-flow effect fortifies our experience to the joke and the show. On its own, the joke may be funny enough, but following a negative experience, it is made that much more impactful. This could possibly be related to the [negativity bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias), as well as other news-related psychological effects. For one, this course correction strengthens dependence on this show. The story is told rather quickly (as a video) and the viewer does not have much time to think about their stance in response to what is being said, especially if it's the first time hearing the news. Before they know it, they are uncomfortable with the news and want out. The show gets them out and the viewer appreciates that. News is already a drug and Last Week Tonight amplifies the effect by cutting it with its own humor.

The story usually ends with some optimism. The show recognizes that something should be done about the problem and does it. That being said, the problem is usually large and so the act of a program of its size is usually small. Examples usually involve an official hashtag that the audience can use as a call to action. While hashtags can be viral, they often aren't and one could argue this could simply be a form of a ratings poll for HBO. Nevertheless, in the viewer's eyes, the problem is getting attention and this can give them a false sense of contribution. This unpacks an additional concern with the show, one about its lasting effect on the audience. The show purports itself to be an active voice against big issues and informing viewers in a light-hearted and humorous way. However, one could argue that this is a wolf in sheep's clothing. The show achieves a level of comedy that actually quells the audience and any meaningful participation they might act upon. People have talked about passivity from watching too much news before, but Last Week Tonight's brand of news additionally sedates the viewer with its jokes and a false sense of contribution which keeps people coming back in droves, preferring the experience over their ordinary news outlets.
