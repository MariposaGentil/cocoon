Watching movies and TV is one of my favorite things to do. Now that streaming has become commonplace, things seem pretty good. However the climate is shifting to an art form for enjoyment to a content factory whose output we must consume. It has now become more inescapable like social media, demand has grown to the point of mindlessness, and I fear my favorite thing will become a hollow shell.

With the rise of bandwidth and ease of access, streaming entertainment has started embedding itself into culture. This prominence is ramping up to social media levels. As of late, social media is experiencing a time of scrutiny for its privacy and health concerns. TV and movies seem to be picking up the slack as the new platform for attention and engagement. Netflix openly admits they view any other activity besides watching Netflix as competition, which includes going out to dinner. An ad for Amazon's Prime Video reads, "Staying in is the new going out."

There is a huge surge in demand for new shows and movies. Everyone--creators, streaming companies, consumers--are trying to find the next blockbuster hit like Game of Thrones. Netflix is pouring billions and an overwhelming majority of spending on new content. Companies like Netflix have famously been more open to TV and movie scripts than long-standing production studios. This can be a good thing, but at the same time, the barrier to entry is technically being lowered and saturation of new content could easily lead to lesser standards and quality in the future. Companies that have entered the streaming industry, such as Amazon and Apple, risk losing focus and cash in doing so. Netflix is currently in tens of million dollars in debt. Can non-incumbents avoid similar risk?

The race to strike gold has also devolved the artful medium into 'content,' a word that white-washes and gives way to attention deficits. It is a word which has leached from the corporate vernacular into the minds of viewers and has altered perceptions on what shows and movies represent.

On the other side of the same coin, viewers also want another Game of Thrones (save for the last season). HBO might release another must-watch show within a year or two, but for now, the position remains unfilled. Stranger Things, though popular and trendy, will likely not carry the torch in a way that people want or expect. In the absence of a front-runner, people will search for something to fill the void.
