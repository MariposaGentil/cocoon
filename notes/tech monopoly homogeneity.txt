Tech Woes

Monopoly (social media, content aggregation) platforms are homogenizing us

Same content trickles down from main sites

Everyone eventually sees that meme/video/tweet

People converge on the same pop culture
	What about non-pop culture? What about factoids and general knowledge?

If people are spending all their time on these platforms, they will most likely be influenced the same way.

The culture of the internet is shaped like a funnel
	Start at the top of the funnel where it's wide open and full of promise
	More time you spend in the funnel, the more of the same stuff you see
		Internet starts to look smaller
	Once you exit the funnel, you are more like the rest of the internet

It's sucking people down along with their individuality, time, attn spans, possibly intellect
