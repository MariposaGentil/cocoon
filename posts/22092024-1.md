I really hope to be able to make something new with this...
Sometimes I need to express myself to noone, so I created this... using the subistes engine of the cocoon main site (for now dead) I started a journal.

Today finaly got time for my self, that feels really good. For two years I've been working on getting my shit together and getting over some difficult stuff. Making new friends, recovering old ones, creating dependency on sports... 

This feels right. This season, for now, feels like I'll be able to get time for myself, for now I'll "only" be doing some Padel and Tenis, so maybe I can focus a lil bit more on other hobbies like: 

- Reading
- Photografy
- Programming a bit
- Cooking
- Cars
- Myself

I really hope this is a cute beginning to a cute journey
