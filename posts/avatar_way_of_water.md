After James announced (**4** new Avatar movies in 2012)[https://www.vulture.com/2012/05/james-cameron-avatar-business.html], it was easy for me to say that Avatar would be a over-exploded franchise.

I didn't liked the first movie script, it was predictable and boring. In my honest opinion, **Avatar** was just a Techincal Demo of a brand new graphic engine capable of managing cute lighting and deep forest, but a movie is way more than that.
