How easy it is to Google anything nowadays; how close we can get to any knowledge we can think of; how nice that is.

The Internet has brought about near-instant access to the world's collective knowledge. This astounding speed has increased to the point where it can play a part in our quick thought processes---I can find answers faster than I can think of them. This supplementary, virtual memory has taken charge in many cases in daily life to the point in which trivial questions are outsourced to the search bar.

In a way, we are becoming more *stateless* in letting the Internet provide a large part of our understanding of the world. We are the terminal: the lazier half compared to the 'server,' which does all the work for us. This can be a dangerous situation without critical thinking. It can start as searching for obscure information which requires encyclopedic knowledge but, over time, the Internet 'answers' more of our questions and we stop thinking for ourselves. Problems arise when these questions transition from objective to the subjective and introspective (i.e. 'what is the matter with me'). As we become more like terminals without critically thinking about what we consume, we start running an internal `eval` on what we read and see.

With the rise of social systems and content aggregation on the web, more people have seen that one video, meme, or tweet. These systems have become monopolies (Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Twitch, Reddit, Twitter in Alexa's [top 50](https://www.alexa.com/topsites) global websites) and are making the virtual world smaller. This spells danger for its users who are taking more cues from the Internet in curating their world views or their character. With more permeation into the fabric of people's lives, global Internet use fosters homogeneity and shrinks the real world too.

- Quick search => dumb terminal
- Dumb terminal => influenced by social media

- More people using internet
- Internet making world figuratively smaller through monopoly sites
	- Monopoly sites bubble up content either they or the populous wants everyone to see
	- There are enough people using the sites so that people don't have to leave front page to be satisfied (short-term)
- People aren't thinking, instead they're searching
	- It's as fast as thought processes, etc.
- B/c it's fast, people are outsources more questions to search
	- Laziness, terminal---server model
- This leads to statelessness where we are immediately discrediting our own critical thinking and going straight for the search bar
	- eval
- The more we become stateless the more we allow the Internet to make up our world view/character
- As the Internet becomes smaller, this statelessness and impressionability leaves us homogenized
	- Leaves the real world smaller as a result
